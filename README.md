A huge Thanks to Kaliba Enterprises Pvt Ltd.
I have builded a patient appointment system where no two appointments overlap. The goal is to ensure that when someone books an appointment, they can only select time slots that are free and available—so no one accidentally ends up with the same appointment time.

Here’s how I plan to structure the system across five main pages:

Home Page:
This will be the first page people see when they visit. It’s going to have a short introduction about the clinic or service, highlighting the key features like appointment booking, referrals, and patient profiles. There will be navigation buttons that allow users to easily move to other parts of the website, like the appointment booking page or their profile. I want this page to be user-friendly and make it clear where people need to go to book an appointment or refer someone.

Appointment Booking Page:
This is where patients can book their appointments. They’ll be able to choose a date and time. I’m making sure the system only shows available slots, meaning if someone else has already booked a time, it won’t show up as an option. I’ll do this by checking the appointments database in real time and filtering out booked slots. Once a patient selects a date and available time, they’ll confirm it with the system, and I’ll make sure the booking is stored without any errors. I’m also considering adding a confirmation pop-up, so patients can double-check before they book.

Referral Page:
I’m including a feature where patients can refer their friends or family to the clinic. This page will be a simple form where they can enter the friend’s name, email, and a personal message. I’ll make sure the system sends out an email or a notification to the referred person, inviting them to book an appointment. It’s a nice touch to help grow the patient base through word of mouth.

Profile Page:
The profile page is where patients can see their details. They’ll be able to view their name, contact info, and a history of their appointments. I’ll also include a section for upcoming appointments so they know what’s scheduled. If they need to change their profile information—like updating an email address or phone number—I’ll make sure they can do that directly from this page. Additionally, they’ll have options to reschedule or cancel appointments if necessary.

Confirmation Page:
After a patient successfully books an appointment, they’ll be taken to this page, which confirms the details of their booking. I’ll display the exact date and time, so they know it’s been locked in. There will also be options for the patient to modify or cancel the appointment directly from here if their plans change. This will give them peace of mind, knowing their appointment is confirmed and easily manageable.

To prevent overlapping bookings, I have implemented logic both on the backend and frontend. The backend will check the database to see if a selected time slot is already booked before confirming any new appointment. On the frontend, I’ll ensure that when a patient selects a date, the time dropdown only shows time slots that are free, so no one can pick an already-booked time. This approach guarantees there’s no double-booking, making the system reliable for both patients and staff.
